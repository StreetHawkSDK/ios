## Cocopods Installation

1. Install [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).
2. Add pod line into your Podfile and run "pod install". There are two ways:

1) add whole StreetHawk iOS SDK.

    pod "streethawk"
    
2) add sub-module as need. Available sub-modules include:

    pod "streethawk/Core"  #core component for register install, sending logs, tag, trace App status. Other sub-module depends on Core, it's automatically included in other sub-module, no need to specifically add. For example, use pod "streethawk/Growth" is enough, it will automatically sync pod "streethawk/Core".
    pod "streethawk/Growth"  #growth sharing.
    pod "streethawk/Push"  #push notification.
    pod "streethawk/Locations"  #trace latitude/longitude location.
    pod "streethawk/Geofence"  #trace user location by geofence, usually work together with push notification.
    pod "streethawk/Beacons"  #trace user location by enter iBeacon region, usually work together with push notification.
    pod "streethawk/Crash"  #submit crash report.
    pod "streethawk/Feed"  # handle feed.
