/**
A core class to monitor location change. By default process of StreetHawk SDK, it works in the following way:

- When the App is in foreground, it uses startUpdatingLocation to monitor location position and change. The SHLocationManagerUpdateLocation notification is sent after fgMinTimeBetweenEvents (default: 1 minute) and fgMinDistanceBetweenEvents (default: 100 meters).
- When App is in background, it uses startMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges to monitor location change. The SHLocationManagerUpdateLocation notification sent after bgMinTimeBetweenEvents (default: 5 minute) and bgMinDistanceBetweenEvents (default: 500 meters).
- These defaults can be overriden for your specific application.
- The SHLocationManager automatically manages/monitors the foreground/background state, so there is no requirement from the App developer. It should be noted that if the screen is turned off while the App is in the foreground, this is treated as a transition to background.
- Even if the App crashes or is terminated, or phone power off/on, the App will be woken up and put in background because significant location monitoring.
- Once location update notification occur, (according to the algorithm above) logs are post to server immediately, and install updated.
 
 **Related project settings:**
    In "Required background modes" there is a choice for location service (Location updates). Note: this is ONLY for keeping standard location service to run at background; it has NO effect for significant location service. With or without this setting checked, significant location service keeps running at background, or even App is terminated or Phone power off/on. Because StreetHawk SDK uses standard location update in foreground, uses significant location update in background, there is NO need to check this setting.
 
 **Debug Tips:**
 * Xcode can simulate location, but it only works for standard location service, not works for significant location service (both simulator and device). To test significant location update, the only way is to travel with device.
 * Even without background mode checked, standard location service not stop immediately when click home button to put App go to background. When the App is in background, you can still see location update delegate triggered. But once you lock screen, the standard location service stop.
 * If kill App in Xcode, significant location cannot wake up automatically. Need to turn App on, even manually kill it in device.
 
 Normally caller does not need to start/stop location service, or set the properties. Caller just need to visit the location properties. But the control API also provided.

/**
 Start monitor a region, either geo-location region or iBeacon region. 
 
 **Important notice:**
 
 1. If there is already a region with same type and same `identifier`, monitor a region will cause previous one removed!!! For example, following code:
    `CLRegion *r1 = [[CLRegion alloc] initWith... identifier:@"123"];`
    `[StreetHawk.locationManager startMonitoriBeacon:r1];`
    `CLRegion *r2 = [[CLRegion alloc] initWith... identifier:@"123"];`
    `[StreetHawk.locationManager startMonitoriBeacon:r2];`
    Result is: ONLY r2 region is monitored!!! r1 is not monitored because they share same `identifier` (not `proximity uuid`). Must change r2's identifier to another one, for example @"12345", then both r1 and r2 are monitored. To assist user find this StreetHawk prints console warning log to let user know. System CLLocationManager has no feedback for this.
 
 2. Match to a region does not consider `identifier`, only `proximity UUID`, `major` and `minor` considered. For example, iBeacon UUID="abc", major=1, minor=2 matches region UUID="abc", identifier = "123", and it matches region UUID="abc", identifier = "456".
 
 3. `region` property decides the callback delegate:
   - region.notifyOnEntry decide whether `- (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didEnterRegion:(CLRegion *)region` is called when enter this region. Default is YES.
   - region.notifyOnExit decide whether `- (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didExitRegion:(CLRegion *)region` is called when exit the region. Default is YES.
   - if it's CLBeaconRegion, region.notifyEntryStateOnDisplay decide how `- (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didDetermineState:(CLRegionState)state forRegion:(CLRegion *)region` is called. Default is NO. If YES it's called when region enter or exit (same as didEnterRegion and didExitRegion), and also when screen turn on (not App go FG), all "inside" region is called; if NO it's called only when enter or exit a region.
 
 4. If an App start monitor region and no code to stop, kill the App, launch it again, it continue monitoring and trigger delegate, no need to start monitoring again. In iOS 7 the App need to manually launch; since iOS 7.1 the App automatically launch.
 
 5. When call `startMonitorRegion`, only `didDetermineState` calls, no `didEnterRegion` or `didExitRegion` called!!! Later when enter/exit region, they all called. Enter and exit must cross boundary, while state not need.
 
 6. Must have "Background App Refresh" enabled, otherwise none of `didDetermineState` nor `didEnterRegion` nor `didExitRegion` delegate get called. It starts monitor and then slient.
 
 @param region The region to be monitor.
 @return If this region starts to monitor, return YES; otherwise return NO for example SDK not enabled, system location service disabled, not support monitor this region etc.
