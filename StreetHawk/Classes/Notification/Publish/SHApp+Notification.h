 1. If user set `isDefaultNotificationEnabled = NO` before calling `registerInstallForApp...`, notification is not register and system permission dialog not promote.
 2. Call `registerInstallForApp... `, it will not register notification.
 3. Later when user wants to do register, set `isNotificationEnabled = YES` and system permission dialog promote.
 4. Step 1 is optional. If not manually set `isDefaultNotificationEnabled = NO`, it's YES by default and system permission dialog show when `registerInstallForApp` called at very first launch.
 5. Set `isNotificationEnabled = NO` again after `isNotificationEnabled = YES` makes StreetHawk server receive `revoked`, and cause StreetHawk server not send notification to client. But it does not call system unregisterForRemoteNotification, so this App can still receive remote notification from other way.
